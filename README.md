- Network connectivity (for downloading PyPI packages)
- Working knowledge of Python is a plus, but not required.

All Cisco devices are provided! We are providing mocked devices which are
sufficient for this workshop.

## Usage Instructions

#### Step 1. Create a Python virtual environment

In a new shell window:

```bash
# create a development directory
cd ~/workspace
mkdir ~/devnet-2595
cd devnet-2595

# create python virtual environment
python3 -m venv .

# activate virtual environment
source bin/activate

# update your pip/setuptools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
```

#### Step 2. Install Genie, pyATS, and Robot Framework

Installing `genie` and `genie.libs.robot` will automatically install all required
dependencies, including `pyats` and `pyats.robot` Robot Framework keyword support.

```bash
# install genie and genie robot library
pip install genie genie.libs.robot
```

#### Step 3. Clone this repository

```bash
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/CiscoTestAutomation/CL-DevNet-2595.git workshop
```

and now you should be ready to get going! You are now ready to continue to the [Workshop](workshop.md)!


 The below section will assume you have done the above and the Virtual
environment is sourced.
